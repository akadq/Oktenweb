<h3>About the Simpsons family</h3>
<p>
    The Simpson family consists of fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The
    Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa, and
    Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were
    created by
    cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own
    name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were later spun
    off
    into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989.

    Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The
    most
    commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier;
    and
    the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include Homer's mother Mona
    Simpson,
    Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other minor relatives

    Homer Jay Simpson (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is the protagonist of the show and the father of the Simpson family.
    He
    embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless and a
    borderline alcoholic.[18] He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the
    situation
    calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his own values, including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his
    family. His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice
    during
    the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions.[11] Homer has
    since become one of the most influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday
    Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time.[19] He has inspired an entire line of merchandise, and his
    catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary.[20] During the
    production of
    the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with the idea of giving Homer a long lost illegitimate biological
    daughter, but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully, as well as Matt Groening rejected the idea, the
    writers
    changed the story so the clown Krusty would be the one who finds he has a lost daughter.

    Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is the eldest child and only son in the family—at age
    10. Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and
    sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name "Bart" is an
    anagram of the word "brat".[28] Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child
    character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one
    person.[28] Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart.[29][30] Bart's catchphrase "Eat
    My Shorts" was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, harking back to an incident when she
    was at college.[31] In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th
    century, and the only fictional character to make the list.[32] He had previously appeared on the cover of the
    December 31, 1990 edition.[33] Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which led some parents'
    groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H.
    W. Bush to rally, "We're going to keep trying to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons
    and less like the Simpsons."[34] Bart, and other Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television
    commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with the slogan "Nobody better lay a finger on
    my Butterfinger!"[35]

<p>
    Lisa Marie Simpson (voiced by Yeardley Smith) is the eldest daughter and middle child of the family. She is an
    extremely intelligent 8-year-old girl, one of the most intelligent characters on the show. Lisa's political
    convictions are generally socially liberal.[36] She is a vegetarian, and a supporter of the Free Tibet movement,[37]
    and while still supportive of the Christian church in which she was raised,[38] Lisa became a practicing Buddhist
    following her decision to follow the Noble Eightfold Path.[39] She is musically proficient on the saxophone; besides
    the occasional riff during the opening credit sequence Carole King's Jazzman and Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street have
    been prominently placed during episodes. In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was more of a "female Bart" and was
    equally mischievous. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional
    character with "Krusty Gets Busted" being one of the first episodes where her true intelligence is fully shown.[40]
    When she was a baby, Bart started out not liking her, although he became nicer to her after Marge pointed out that
    Lisa loves him. Her first word was "Bart", with Bart happily teaching her more names. Many episodes focusing on Lisa
    have an emotional nature, the first one being "Moaning Lisa". The idea for the episode was pitched by James L.
    Brooks, who had wanted to do an emotional episode where Lisa is sad because the show had done a lot of "jokey
    episodes".[41] In 2001 Lisa received a special "board of directors Ongoing Commitment Award" at the Environmental
    Media Awards.[42] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an episode from the seventh season, won both an Environmental Media Award
    for "Best Television Episodic Comedy"[43] and a Genesis Award for "Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing
    Commitment".[44] In Japan, the broadcasters of the series found they were able to turn the apparent viewer dislike
    of the series around by focusing marketing attention on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a
    voice of reason and a force of good in her family and city struck a chord with the Japanese.[45]
